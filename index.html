    <d2>Imagine you're a business owner and you have data on your customers lifetime purchases, purchases in the past year
    and you're about to launch an ad campaign for a new product.
  In order to make the best use of your advertising budget you want to know which customers are more likely to buy it.
  To do this, you first need to group them into categories... But where does each category start/end? </d2>
    </div>
  <div>
    <d1>Instead of trying to answer that question yourself- allow the computer to find optimal groups!</d1>
  </div>
  <div>
  <d1>Select how many groups you'd like and watch as the algorithm works by grouping then resetting the group centers!</d1>

      K-means is an unsupervised Clustering Algorithm and
      it is especially useful for categorizing large multi-variable datasets.
